	<h1>Welcome to Winnie's Space</h1>
	<p>This is where I showcase some of my projects. I realized the best way for me to understand theories is through projects. Writing about the concepts, describing the process, and explaining the results in layman's terms really helped me to gain confidence as an aspiring data scientist. Please reach out if you have any questions!</p>
